# react-webcam-pro

Universal Camera component for React.

Designed with focus on Android and iOS cameras. Works with standard webcams as well.

See [browser compatibility](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream).

> **Note:** WebRTC is only supported on secure connections (HTTPS). You can test and debug from `localhost` in Chrome (this doesn't work in Safari).

## 🔀 Fork Notice

**`react-webcam-pro`** is a community-maintained fork of [`react-camera-pro`](https://github.com/purple-technology/react-camera-pro) by [Purple Technology](https://github.com/purple-technology).

The original package has not been actively maintained for over 2 years, leaving many users with unresolved issues — including React 19 compatibility, styled-components warnings, and various bug fixes. Many of us personally needed these updates, so we decided to fork the project, fix the outstanding issues, and continue maintaining it for the community.

## Migrating from `react-camera-pro`

1. **Install** `react-webcam-pro`:
   ```bash

   ```

2. **Update imports:**
   ```diff
   - import { Camera } from "react-camera-pro";
   + import { Camera } from "react-webcam-pro";
   ```

3. That's it! The API is fully backward compatible. You can now optionally remove the `errorMessages` prop if you were only passing it to avoid TypeScript errors.
